This repository has the main contracts in KyberNetwork platform. There are three main components in this repository including  KyberNetwork contract, KyberReserve and KyberWallet contracts. In addition, we have a couple of mock modules that simulate testnet tokens and centralized exchanges.
This repository is for testing purposes only,  do not use it for real deployment.

# Test

First install dependencies:
```
$ npm i
```
To run all tests:
```
$ npm t
```
If you have issues with running tests, try to remove the build folder and try again:
```
$ rm -rf ./build
```
To avoid recompiling on each test run, you can run in parallel (and continuously):
```
$ npm run compile-watch
```
To run a specific test file:
```
$ npm t -- ./test/kyberNetwork.js
```

To continuously test on changes:
```
$ npm run test-watch
```
Or just run a single test file:
```
$ npm run test-watch -- ./test/kyberReserve.js
```

# Testnet deployment

We have a functional deployment running on kovan testnet. The deployed contracts are as below.

1. KyberNetworkcontract address = [0x11542d7807dfb2b44937f756b9092c76e814f8ed](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x11542d7807dfb2b44937f756b9092c76e814f8ed)

The abi of KyberNetwork contract is available at https://github.com/KyberNetwork/smart-contracts/blob/master/contracts/KyberNetwork.abi

2. Three dummy token contracts created for the demo. Each token/ contract is called "Test i", symbol "TSTi" for `i=0,1,2`.
The addresses for these contracts are 0xbb9c28a16654a0cd510f5b0a250255c4a07211f2, 0x950b87923d52b09b1050abda589f91521e17e606 and 0x2c018fc6c9bb2b7653136dc7c5b7b588f2d11986.

3. The Reserve contract's address on Kovan testnet: 0x60860ce9688f4200e87e61b9a9a171cee1dc5f65


token_i => eth (wei) rate = 2^{i+1} * (10^18), for i = 0,1,2
eth (wei) => token_i rate = (10^18)/2^{i+1}.

reserve has many (10^40) tokens now, but very few ethers.

## Main functions
We describe the main functions of the Kyber contract as below.
### Trade function
```
    function trade( ERC20 source, uint srcAmount,
                    ERC20 dest, address destAddress, uint maxDestAmount,
                    uint minConversionRate,
                    bool throwOnFailure )
```

`throwOnFailure = false`
`maxDestAmount = MAX_UINT`
`destAddress` is a simple account (not a contract).


token address = 0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee means the token is ETH.
If source is ETH then you also need to send ether along with your call.
If source is token, then you need to call token.approve(kyber network address, amount) before your call.

Important notice: any value below 1000 wei/tokens is considered 0. Deals must be over 1000 wei (1000 tokens).

### getRate function
```
    function getRate( ERC20 source, ERC20 dest, uint reserveIndex ) constant returns(uint rate, uint expBlock, uint balance);
```
`reserveIndex` should be 0.
The function returns three numbers (guessing in web3 it is an array of size 3. It is like that in truffle) including rate, expiration block and balance (how many tokens reserve has).


# Kyber wallet contract
Kyber wallet integrates with existing Kyber Network.
A user needs to deploy [this](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/smart-contracts/blob/master/contracts/KyberWallet.sol) contract with c'tor param
`_kyberNetwork = 0x11542d7807dfb2b44937f756b9092c76e814f8ed`.
Then user should send ether and/or tokens to the contract. It can be in a standard way (just `send` or `transfer` ether or tokens to contract address).

The function to call is
```
    function convertAndCall( ERC20 srcToken, uint srcAmount,
                             ERC20 destToken, uint maxDestAmount,
                             uint minRate,
                             address destination,
                             bytes   destinationData,
                             bool onlyApproveTokens,
                             bool throwOnFail ) {
```
If `onlyApproveTokens = true` and `destToken` is not ETH, then function does not transfer tokens to destination, instead it is just appoving it.
If `destinationData` is an empty array, then then default function is called in destination (and destination could also be a standard account).
It is probably better to first try with empty data.
An example to non-empty data can be found [here](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/smart-contracts/blob/master/test/firstscenario.js#L364) and [here](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/smart-contracts/blob/master/test/firstscenario.js#L391).

For basic testings, it is possible to set the wallet as destination address and make the transfer invoke `recieveEther` and `recieveTokens`.
